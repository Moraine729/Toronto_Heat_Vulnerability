## Notes for Result Section  
### This folder contains several shapefile datasets derived in this project  
### These datasets are visualized in ArcGIS and uploaded to folder **Maps** in png format
  
### Sensitivity indices
 &ensp;&ensp; Sensitivity indices are derived based on two different methods based on the census profile and landcover data.  
 
### Adaptive Capacity indices  
&ensp;&ensp; Adaptive capacity indices are derived based on two different methods based on the census profile and accessbility data.  

### Heat Vulnerability indices  
&ensp;&ensp; The ultimate heat vulnerability indices are derived based on previously constructed sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure components.  

### Cluster Analysis
&ensp;&ensp; A further cluster analysis is operated for two derived HVIs to investigate the spatial pattern of heat vulnerability using function **Cluster and Outlier Analysis** in ArcGIS. This function uses Anselin Local Moran's I method and details about this function can be found at <https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/spatial-statistics-toolbox/cluster-and-outlier-analysis-anselin-local-moran-s.htm> .
