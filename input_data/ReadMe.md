 Toronto_DA_boundary.zip:
  This file contains the boundary of dissmination area across the Toronto region in shapefile format. The boundaries of dissmination area in Canada are acquired from Statistic Canada at https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/92-169-X. It is further clipped by the political boundary of Toronto, which is the study area of this project, to derive this shapefile. The political boundary of Toronto is acquired from https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/data-city-toronto-mdl-collection.
  Beside this boundary file at dissmination area level, the Toronto ward profile boundary is retrieved from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/city-wards/ which is visualized for demonstration purpose.
