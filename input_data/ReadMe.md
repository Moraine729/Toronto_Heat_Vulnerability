## This Folder contains all input datasets used in the Toronto heat vulnerability project.

### Toronto_DA_boundary.zip:  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This file contains the boundary of dissmination area across the Toronto region in shapefile format. The boundaries of dissmination area in Canada are acquired from Statistic Canada at <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/92-169-X>. It is further clipped by the political boundary of Toronto, which is the study area of this project, to derive this shapefile. The political boundary of Toronto is acquired from <https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/data-city-toronto-mdl-collection>.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  Beside this boundary file at dissmination area level, the Toronto ward profile boundary is retrieved from <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/city-wards/> which is visualized for demonstration purpose.  
    
  
### Accessbility to Cool centers and Medical Services  
#### **access_hospital.zip**，**access_cool_centers.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;These two shapefiles describe the accessibility to cooling centerings and medicail services for each dissmination area in Toronto. These datasets are constructed based on the location of cooling centers which is acquired from <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/air-conditioned-and-cool-spaces-heat-relief-network/> , and the location of hospitals which is acquired from <http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/> .  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  Statistical surfaces are constructed based on these point features separately using the tool “Euclidean distance” in ArcGIS. A raster surface indicating the distance to the closest point with a pre-defined cell size will be generated in this step. Later, use tool “Zonal statistics” and the dissemination area boundary as input, the average distance for each dissemination area to its closest point feature will be derived, which is used to represent the accessibility in this study.  
  
### Canopy cover percentage at dissmination area level  
#### **canopy_cover.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dataset contains the shapefile which describes the distribution of canopy cover across Toronto at dissmination area level. The original landcover data are retrieved from Toronto open data portal at <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/forest-and-land-cover/> . The downloaded data is further processed in ArcGIS.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  The polygons identified as “tree canopy” is selected and exported to a separate feature. Then the “intersect” function is applied, which further divides the tree canopy polygon based on the boundary of dissemination areas. Then, the function “dissolve” is applied, which merges multiple polygons located inside the common dissemination area into one polygon. At last, the area of each dissolved polygon is calculated based on “calculate geometry” and divided by the total area of dissemination area to receive the percentage of canopy cover.  
  
### Impervious surface cover percentage at dissmination area level  
#### **impervious_percentage.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dataset contains the shapefile which describes the distribution of impervious surfaces across Toronto at dissmination area level. The original impervious/natural surface data are retrieved from Toronto open data portal at <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/topographic-mapping-impermeable-surface/> . The downloaded data is further processed in ArcGIS.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  At first, only raster cells identified as impervious surfaces are extracted, which will be further processed. Then, use the “Zonal statistics as Table” tool, set feature zone data as DA boundary, zone field as “DAUID”, input value raster as impervious raster, and statistics type as “Sum”. Later, join this table with the dissemination area boundary based on “DAUID” and calculate the percentage of impervious surface coverage, which equals the count of impervious cells multiply the unit area of each cell and divided by the area of each dissemination area, using “Field calculator”.
