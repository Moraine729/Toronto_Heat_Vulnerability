## This Folder contains all input datasets used in this Toronto heat vulnerability project.

### Toronto_DA_boundary.zip:  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This file contains the boundary of dissmination area across the Toronto region in shapefile format. The boundaries of dissmination area in Canada are acquired from Statistic Canada at <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/92-169-X>. It is further clipped by the political boundary of Toronto, which is the study area of this project, to derive this shapefile. The political boundary of Toronto is acquired from <https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/data-city-toronto-mdl-collection>.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  Beside this boundary file at dissmination area level, the Toronto ward profile boundary is retrieved from <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/city-wards/> which is visualized for demonstration purpose.  
    
  
### Accessbility to Cool centers and Medical Services  
#### **access_hospital.zip**，**access_cool_centers.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;These two shapefiles describe the accessibility to cooling centerings and medicail services for each dissmination area in Toronto. These datasets are constructed based on the location of cooling centers which is acquired from <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/air-conditioned-and-cool-spaces-heat-relief-network/> , and the location of hospitals which is acquired from <http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/> .  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  Statistical surfaces are constructed based on these point features separately using the tool “Euclidean distance” in ArcGIS. A raster surface indicating the distance to the closest point with a pre-defined cell size will be generated in this step. Later, use tool “Zonal statistics” and the dissemination area boundary as input, the average distance for each dissemination area to its closest point feature will be derived, which is used to represent the accessibility in this study.  
  
### Canopy cover percentage at dissmination area level  
#### **canopy_cover.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dataset contains the shapefile which describes the distribution of canopy cover across Toronto at dissmination area level. The original landcover data are retrieved from Toronto open data portal at <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/forest-and-land-cover/> . The downloaded data is further processed in ArcGIS.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  The polygons identified as “tree canopy” is selected and exported to a separate feature. Then the “intersect” function is applied, which further divides the tree canopy polygon based on the boundary of dissemination areas. Then, the function “dissolve” is applied, which merges multiple polygons located inside the common dissemination area into one polygon. At last, the area of each dissolved polygon is calculated based on “calculate geometry” and divided by the total area of dissemination area to receive the percentage of canopy cover.  
  
### Impervious surface cover percentage at dissmination area level  
#### **impervious_percentage.zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dataset contains the shapefile which describes the distribution of impervious surfaces across Toronto at dissmination area level. The original impervious/natural surface data are retrieved from Toronto open data portal at <https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/topographic-mapping-impermeable-surface/> . The downloaded data is further processed in ArcGIS.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  At first, only raster cells identified as impervious surfaces are extracted, which will be further processed. Then, use the “Zonal statistics as Table” tool, set feature zone data as DA boundary, zone field as “DAUID”, input value raster as impervious raster, and statistics type as “Sum”. Later, join this table with the dissemination area boundary based on “DAUID” and calculate the percentage of impervious surface coverage, which equals the count of impervious cells multiply the unit area of each cell and divided by the area of each dissemination area, using “Field calculator”.  
  
### Heat exposure at dissmination area level  
#### **exposure(degree_day_20).zip**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dataset contains the shapefile which describes the distribution of heat exposure across Toronto at dissmination area level. The heat exposure is characterized as the heat degree day index with threshold at 20 ℃ and constructed based on the land surface temperature (LST) measured by MODIS products MOD11A1. Images measured from 2010 to 2019 during each JJA (June, July, August) are acquired from The Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System (LAADS) at <https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/> . The downloaded data are modified using script in **process_MODIS** section first to aggragate the average heat degree day for each pixel during the study period. Later, it is further processed in ArcGIS.  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  The pre-processed raster data, which stores the average heat degree days throughout the study period, are exported in Geotiff format and further processed in ArcGIS to transform the spatial scale from 100 meters into dissemination area level. First, the function “raster to polygon” is applied to the image, which transforms the data from raster format into vector format. However, since ArcGIS requires the value of the input raster in an integer type, the images are multiplied by 100000 using the raster calculator and transformed from float to integer using the function “int”. This multiplied coefficient will be removed in the ultimate result later. Since the boundary of remote sensing images does not perfectly align with the boundary of the study area, the generated polygon feature is clipped first. Then, this feature intersects with the dissemination area feature, which breaks down into numerous smaller polygons. For each polygon, its area is divided by its corresponding dissemination area and multiplied with the exposure data to determine its relative contribution to the entire dissemination area. At last, the function “dissolve” is applied, which merges all polygons based on “DAUID,” and the ultimate exposure value for each dissemination area is derived through aggregation.  
  
### Census profile at dissmination area level
#### **Toronto_census.dbf****census_header.txt**  
  &ensp;&ensp;
  This dbf file contains all the census data at dissmination area level used in this study. The census data is downloaded from CHASS Canadian Census Analyser at <http://datacentre.chass.utoronto.ca/> . The header is stored seperately in census_header.txt. This file will be joined with the dissmination area boundary shapefile in ArcGIS later based on DAUID code in next step.
